Analyze A/B Test Results
The current notebook is organised into the following sections:

Introduction
Part I - Probability
Part II - A/B Test
Part III - Regression

Introduction
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Our goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:

1. Implement the new webpage,
2. Keep the old webpage, or
3. Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

This repository contains a jupyter notebook that analyses the data about the conversion of customers belonging to two groups - control group and treatment group, control group being poeple who were shown old page and treatment group being people who were shown new webpage and a conversion column containing binary numbers - 1 for converted, 0 for not converted. Another data set contains information about the user's country. This data is in csv files - ab_data.csv and countries.csv
